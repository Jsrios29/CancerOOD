# CancerOOD
A project that uses out-of-distribution detection frameworks to detect abnormal tissue such as breast cancer in breast histopathological images

## Summary
The goal of this project is to use out-of-distribution (OOD) detection frameworks to flag abnormal tissue in histpathological images of of human breast tissue. We train Deep neural networks to identify among healthy breast and healthy lymph node tissue, then we apply OOD detection frameworks, such as energy-based, Outlier-Exposure, and ODIN on breast tissue images with the presence of normal and abornam tissue such as ductal in situ and invasive carcinoma.
